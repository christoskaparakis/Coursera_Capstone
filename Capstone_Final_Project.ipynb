As from Real Estate investor point of view we want to invest in such places were the housing prices are low and the facilities(shops,restaurants,parks,Hotels, etc.) and social venues are nearby. Keeping above things in mind it is very difficult for an individual to find such place in such big city and gather this much information. When we consider all these problems, we can create a map and information chart where the real estate index is placed on London and each district is clustered according to the venue density."
